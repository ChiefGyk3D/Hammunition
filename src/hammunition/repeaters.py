"""Repeater overlays from the operator's own export, converted here.  D-064.

The operator exports repeaters from a source they hold an account with
(RepeaterBook's website export, as GPX or CSV), types their own list, or asks
for hearham.com's open list; this reads it and writes three overlays into
``$XDG_DATA_HOME/hammunition/overlays/repeaters/``: a GPX for QMapShack's
File → Load and for phones, a Mapsforge ``.poi`` that QMapShack keeps as a POI
collection, and a Navit textfile map. Nothing here fetches anything, except
:func:`fetch_hearham`, and only when the operator runs
``maps repeaters fetch-hearham``.

Not a D-049 data unit: an export is neither fetched by the engine nor
pinnable, and RepeaterBook's terms forbid anyone else holding it. The files
are the operator's, mode 0600, never under the root prefix and never in the
transaction log.

Inputs are recognised from their content (:func:`read_input`). A CHIRP CSV
and a CHIRP radio image carry no coordinates -- CHIRP's own RepeaterBook
query was measured to drop Lat/Long and keep "near <city>" -- so both are
refused by name, as are a RepeaterBook CSV without Lat and Long, and KML,
which is deferred (the same data as the GPX). Guessing a position from a town
name would invent one.

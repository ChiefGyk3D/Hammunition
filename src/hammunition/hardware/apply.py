"""Planning the hardware role: udev rules and group membership. D-029, M4.

The detection and rule-generation engines already exist (:mod:`.detect`,
:mod:`.udev`); this is the piece that turns them into *what an apply will do to
this machine* — the same disclose-everything-first shape ``install`` has. It
computes a plan and changes nothing; the CLI renders it, and only then runs it.

Two system changes, both idempotent and both disclosed:

- **The rules file.** The whole catalog's rules go to
  ``/etc/udev/rules.d/65-hammunition.rules`` — declarative and harmless for a
  device that is not attached, so writing all of them means a supported device
  works the moment it is plugged in, not only if it happened to be present at
  apply time. If the file on disk already matches, that half is a no-op.
- **Group membership.** The union of the access groups the catalog's devices
  need (``plugdev``, ``dialout``) — added only where the operator is not
  already a member.

Detection is reported alongside but drives nothing (D-020): an apply writes the
same rules whether or not the operator's HackRF is plugged in right now.

    ``attached`` overrides bus detection: its real inputs are root-owned

    time's grants (D-058); `list` and `doctor` leave it off, so neither asks

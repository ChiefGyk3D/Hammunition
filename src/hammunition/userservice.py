"""Planning and rendering user services.  D-073 §6, amended 2026-10-02.

Pure: given a manifest's ``user_services`` block, the station, and the hardware
catalog, it decides what to render, defer or skip, and produces the unit-file
text. A *plain* service (no station condition, no station value, no device)
needs neither the station nor the catalog and is always planned; the rig's
services are the ones that need both. The engine (``execute.py``) writes it as the operator and enables it; the
plan view (``interface/plan.py``) discloses it. Nothing here touches the
filesystem or systemd.

The unit file is rendered from fixed fields — the catalog never carries unit
syntax (D-073 §6). A station value is substituted into ``exec`` and re-checked
by the same rule the schema enforces, so a value that slipped a shell character
past ``station set`` cannot reach ``ExecStart=``.

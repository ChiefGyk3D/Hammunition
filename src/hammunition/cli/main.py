"""The ``hammunition`` command.

``argparse`` rather than a dependency: the CLI surface is four verbs, and a
tool whose whole pitch is "you can read what it is going to do to your machine"
should be installable without pulling anything extra in to parse its own
arguments.

The verbs are ``install``, ``uninstall``, ``list``, ``status``, ``show``,
``menus``, ``hardware`` and ``station``, all with the M1 property intact: what the engine cannot do it says
so, by name. Every backend the 1.0 measurement requires is written (apt, source,
git, binary, venv, and node by D-037); pipx and CPAN re-measured to zero and a
package declaring one is refused with the backend named rather than skipped. CLAUDE.md forbids a shim
that makes an unsupported combination appear to work, and a CLI that quietly
drops the packages it cannot handle is that shim.

Exit codes, because scripts read them:

==  ==============================================================
0   Success, or a dry run that resolved cleanly
1   A command failed while running, or the system is unsupported
2   The transaction could not be planned — every blocker is printed
3   A consent gate was declined, or could not be presented
==  ==============================================================

    """Remove the privileged artefacts an apply installed, and nothing else.

    Not part of ``uninstall``: that command resolves names against the package
    and profile catalogs and there is no unit named ``hardware`` to give it
    (D-056). This removes exactly what the transaction log records *we* put
    there -- never a path we merely expect to exist, because a file at the
    helper's path that we did not write belongs to whoever did.

    **Narrower still: only a path this command owns.** ``--user`` lets an
    operator read *another* account's transaction log, which that account can
    append to freely -- so a log is data, not an instruction, and a `path`
    entry in it is honoured only when it is exactly the helper or the policy
    path. Anything else the log names is reported and skipped, never removed,
    because a root ``rm -f`` for an arbitrary string an unprivileged account
    once wrote into its own log file is not a promise this command makes.

    The device-access udev rules file (D-029) is deliberately left alone. It
    is declarative, it is harmless for a device that is not attached, and
    removing it would take away device access an operator is still using.
    Power control is the reversible part; permissions are not.

    **The kept-off rules file (D-056) is different and is removed here.** It
    exists only because ``park`` was told to keep a device parked, and its
    entries are power-control intent, not permissions -- so if it is present
    it is removed along with the helper and the policy action, and udev is
    told to reload so every device it was holding parked wakes from the next
    boot.

    **GPS time (D-058) is taken back by content, not by the log.** A file is
    removed only when it starts with the header Hammunition writes, ntp.conf's
    marked lines are restored byte for byte, and only Hammunition's block
    leaves ntpd's AppArmor local file. A hand-edited ntp.conf is refused
    before anything runs.

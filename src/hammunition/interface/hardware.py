"""``hardware state`` as data.  D-059, D-056.

Each device carries the same keys, and the same values, the privileged
helper's ``state`` array does (name, summary, address, identifier, method,
parked, kept, attached), so a front end reading either source reads one
shape -- a tray that switches source must see the same thing. ``kept`` and
``attached`` are real here, not placeholders: a device kept parked across a
reboot but not currently on the bus is carried too, the way the helper and
the kept-off text form (D-056) both already do, with the same ``parked:
null`` / ``method: "usb_deauthorize"`` / name-sorted shape the helper uses
for a row with nothing attached.

"""Where the engine keeps things, and whose they are.

Two directories matter: the transaction log under ``$XDG_STATE_HOME`` and the
verified-artifact cache under ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME``. Both face the same problem
and it is subtle enough that two copies of the answer would drift, which is why
it is written once here.

**The problem is sudo.** ``hammunition install`` needs root for ``apt-get`` and
for ``make install``, so it is usually run under sudo — and sudo resets ``HOME``
to ``/root``. Following ``$HOME`` would put the operator's transaction history
and their downloaded artifacts somewhere they cannot read, while the same
command run as themselves reports an empty log and an empty cache. The engine
already works out who the operator is, because ``gpasswd`` needs a name; this
uses that name.

``$XDG_*`` is deliberately **not** consulted in the root-with-an-owner case: it
either does not survive ``env_reset`` or it belongs to root, and neither is the
operator's.
